title: Split and Extract a Document
openapi: "openapi-documents POST /v1/documents/{document_id}/extraction"
---

The **Split and Extract a Document** endpoint allows you to process a document by splitting it according to specified extraction types and performing extraction on each split section. This is useful for handling complex documents where different parts of the document need to be analyzed or extracted separately based on defined extraction schemas.

**Request Body Parameters:**

- `extraction_ids` (array of strings): A list of extraction type IDs that dictate how the document should be split and extracted. Each ID corresponds to a specific extraction schema that defines the rules for processing each section of the document.

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.pardocs.com/v1/documents/{document_id}/extraction \
  --header 'x-api-key: <api-key>'
  --data '{
  "extraction_ids": [
    "<string>"
  ]
}'
```
```python Python
import json
import requests

url = "https://api.pardocs.com/v1/documents/{document_id}/extraction"
headers = {
    "x-api-key": "<api-key>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
data = {"extraction_ids": ["<string>"]}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))

print(response.json())
```
