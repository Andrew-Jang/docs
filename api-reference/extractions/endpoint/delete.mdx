The **Delete Extraction Schema** endpoint allows you to remove an existing extraction schema identified by `{extraction_id}`. This operation will delete the specified schema and it will no longer be available for data extraction tasks. 

Use this endpoint to clean up or manage your schemas by removing those that are no longer needed.

<Note>Note that this process can also be done in the [ParDocs Console](https://www.pardocs.com)</Note>

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://api.pardocs.com/v1/extractions/{extraction_id}"
headers = {"x-api-key": "<api-key>"}

response = requests.delete(url, headers=headers)

print(response.json())
```
